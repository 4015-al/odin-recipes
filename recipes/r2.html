  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <p>yields 1 servings</p>

  <ul>  
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons butter or margarine</li>
    <li>Â¼ cup (25 grams) cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li> Break two eggs into a bowl. Make sure that the eggs are room temperature. Cold eggs can lead to a tough, over-cooked omelette.[3] </li>
    <li>Beat the eggs with a fork or whisk. You want to break up the yolks until there are no strands or globs left. The mixture should be a little frothy.[4] If you wish, you can add a pinch of salt and a dash of pepper at this point. </li>
    <li> Butter an 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) skillet. Turn on your stove and set the heat to medium. Place the skillet on the burner and drop 2 teaspoons of butter or margarine onto the surface. Using the handle, tilt the skillet around until the entire surface is covered with the melting butter. This will prevent the eggs from sticking to the surface of the pan.</li>
    <li>Pour the egg mix onto the skillet. Shake and tilt the skillet so that the egg mixture coats the bottom. </li>
    <li>Continue spreading the egg around with a spatula. As the top of the omelette begins to set, run your spatula around the edges of the omelette. Lift them up slightly to let the uncooked egg flow under the omelette.</li>
    <li> Add the cheese just before the omelette finishes cooking. When the omelette is still runny and shiny on top, sprinkle the cheese down the middle of it. The omelette will continue cooking after you fold it in half. If you wait until the omelette is fully-cooked! the result will be a very dry omelette</li>
    <li>Fold the omelet in half. Slide the spatula under one part of the omelette and lift, flipping the omelette over onto itself</li>
    <li> Finish cooking the omelette, then transfer it to a plate. When the underside of the omelette starts to turn golden brown, take the skillet off the burner. Use a spatula to slide the omelette off the skillet and onto a plate. </li>
    <li> Garnish and serve the omelette. You can serve the omelette as it is, or you can garnish it with some herbs, such as chives, basil, oregano, or parsley.</li>
  </ol>
